I made this game in 2020 summer. It is made in pygame python. I also did all the arts. The sound effects are found online.
# LittleZombieSpring

Udring the pandemic I feel so isolated just like the main charactor in the game, but it also makes me realize that your fineds, your family and people who love you will always be wiht you and support you. So, this is the insperation of the game.

If you are in windows, you may open the exe file to play the game
